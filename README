The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Commission for Basic Systems (CBS) met in 1985 to create the GRIB (GRIdded Binary) format. The WGDM in February 1994, after major changes, approved revision 1 of the GRIB format. GRIB Edition 2 format was approved in 2003 at Geneva.


#### GRIB1 notes
X is known as shortName = 10u (the 10 makes for base ten is a guess)
Y is known as shortName = 10v



#### WGRIB commands
./wgrib -s ~/.zygrib/grib/sample.grb | grep ":12hr fcst:" | ./wgrib -i -text ~/.zygrib/grib/sample.grb -o outfile

./wgrib -s -d 1 ~/.zygrib/grib/sample.grb | ./wgrib -i -text ~/.zygrib/grib/sample.grb -o outfile1

#### gribapi
I had to move the default installed files from 
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/grib_api
to
/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/grib_api
and add an __init__.py to load the module properly.


#### Python notes
math.atan2(y, x)

    Return atan(y / x), in radians. The result is between -pi and pi. The vector in the plane from the origin to point (x, y) makes this angle with the positive X axis. The point of atan2() is that the signs of both inputs are known to it, so it can compute the correct quadrant for the angle. For example, atan(1) and atan2(1, 1) are both pi/4, but atan2(-1, -1) is -3*pi/4. Usee math.degree to convert it from radians to degrees.
