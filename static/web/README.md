A basic collection of best practices for a lightweight and performance conscious website.

Takes into account browser support issues, implements responsive design and progressive enhancement.

The aim is to have a quick overview for what should best not be forgotten in making a new website.



## Quickstart

Requires a HTTP server with PHP.


Clone the repository to your htdocs and view the webroot/index.php with browser.


Enhancements, pollyfills and addons are in the assets folder under either css or js.


## Documentation

Currently the site is for development purposes. The CSS uses a pre-compiler; LESS, and currently that is done with a client-side javascript-based compiler. Obviously a production site has minimised CSS, and probably files combined for minimum HTTP requests.


There is also simple script using jQuery to lazy-load pictures only on WVP (Wide View Port) devices.
